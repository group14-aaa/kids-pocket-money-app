//User story

// I am a parent that wants to assign chores to my children. I want to reward them for completing tasks set each day / week and to calculate their weekly pocket money based on chores completed.

//MVP features

//When the parent adds a task, it will add this to the jobs list for that week (as a modal)
//Tasks can added to each day of the week (or multiple)
//It is possible to add a chore value to each task
//A tick box is required for each task, the chore value of completed task stored in local storage

//When all tasks are completed, a reward (api picture / gif or similar is displyaed to user)
//At the end of the week, the total value of tasks are calculated
//start new week button, this can copy all tasks from previous week and wipe local storage 



Api ideas....
//Api's - a reward api when task (or set of tasks complete) - i.e Roblox? or giphy celebration 
//APi - date and time, picture of the day (nasa)
//api - reccomend book
// pokemon api?
//marvel api?
//research more api's rapidapi.com + publicapi.dev

//local storage - different accounts for adult / child (add password, username, need to use same browser)
//ability for adult to review the completed tasks before pocket money calculated
